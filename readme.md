# Springboard Memory Game Project

This is a simple memory game submitted for the Springboard Software Engineering class Sep20. The game works as follow:

---

- The timer starts once you click on the first card.
- The move counter adds one after a round's second card is clicked.
- You may restart the game at any time by clicking on the Restart Game button.
- Once you match all the tiles, the game will show you how many moves you made.

---

## Things that could be added

- Add a local storage feature to keep track of the highest score.
- Show the amount of time taken to complete the game.
- Create a total game score by integrating the number of moves it takes in the least amount of time.
